‚òÑÔ∏è **dyco-coroutine** is a dynamic coroutine framework for C. I hope this framework to be TRULY **practical** and **user-friendly**, rather than just a coroutine demo. This framework was first inspired by the `wangbojing/NtyCo` project. Some other projects are also referred, such as `cloudwu/coroutine`, `jamwt/libtask` and `stevedekorte/coroutine`.

With this framework, programers can achieve asynchronous I/O performance by programming in a synchronous manner. And I want this framework to work out-of-the-box: you just create a coroutine to run your functions, and I'll provide all tools that you need (such as scheduler, socket and synchronization), then all the functions run as coroutines do. Besides, I provide detailed examples that covers almost all supported features of dyco. Anyone can get started within 5 minite by reviewing and running these examples.

Features of dyco-coroutine:
1. Fully automated coroutine scheduling.
2. Either shared or separate stacks can be set for coroutines.
3. Coroutines pool for better performance.
4. Socket/epoll hooks to automatically change the behavior of the socket/epoll API.
5. Wait signal events. Especially waitchild, which is works well with `fork()+exec()`.
6. Allow epoll inside each coroutine without blocking the scheduler.
7. Half duplex channel and Publish-Subcribe channel for coroutine communication.
8. Semaphore and Waitgroup for coroutine synchronization.
9. TLS/SSL non-block concurrent server support.
10. Scheduler and be stopped by any coroutine, and continue running in main process.
11. Multi-thread supported.
12. Asymmetric coroutine is supported.
13. Supports prioritized scheduling of urgent coroutine.

Why choose `dyco-coroutine`?
1. Excellent performance.
2. Elegant programming style.
3. No dependency and easy to build/install/link.
4. Well-documented and actively maintained by developers.

There are still some future works:
1. Better cross-platform support. Currently the cross-platform design is derive from `jamwt/libtask`. But now only Linux OS is supported (i386 AMD64 ARM ARM64...). Future work can be referred to `heiher/hev-task-system` and `tboox/tbox`.
2. Discover more feature requests and bugs by getting more people to use them.
3. Performance optimization. Using ucontext predestines the framework to not be the best at switching performance. But there is still room for optimization.
4. Simpler build solution. Don't make things more complicated.
5. Buffered Channel.
6. Thread-Specific Pointer Wrapper.
7. Buffered channel.

# User APIs

## Coroutine & Coroutines Pool

Some basic coroutine methods are defined here. `sleep/wait/coroID` can only be called inside coroutine functions.

`setStack` is **optional**. If the stack is not set before the coroutine runs. All coroutines whose stack is not set will share the stack of the scheduler. It saves memory space, but costs time for copying stacks when these coroutines yield. Thus, if a coroutine need frequently yield, it's better to set a stack for it. See more in `example/*`.

**Coroutines Pool** is provided to avoid create and release coroutine/stack memory frequently. The coroutines pool can be create at any time and be resized after it created. Coroutines who belongs to a corotines pool will automatically return to the pool after user function finishes. By calling `obtain`, you can get a free coroutine from the pool. See more in `example/coropool_example.c`.

**Two-level priority** scheduling strategy is provided for some urgent coroutines. By calling `create_urgent` or `obtain_urgent`, you can get an urgent coroutine which tends to be woken up earlier than others. The urgent attribution can also be `setUrgent` or `unsetUrgent` inside a coroutine.

```c
// return the coroutine ID on success, < 0 on error
int dyco_coroutine_create(proc_coroutine func, void *arg);
// this new coroutine will be resume as soon as possible
int dyco_coroutine_create_urgent(proc_coroutine func, void *arg);

void dyco_coroutine_sleep(uint32_t msecs);

// this coroutine will abort itself but no affect other coroutines.
void dyco_coroutine_abort();

// set timeout to -1 for persistent waiting. set timeout to 0 for no waiting
// return > 0 on success, 0 on timeout, < 0 on error
int dyco_coroutine_waitRead(int fd, int timeout);
int dyco_coroutine_waitWrite(int fd, int timeout);
int dyco_coroutine_waitRW(int fd, int timeout);

// return ID of current coroutine
int dyco_coroutine_coroID();

// stacksize: 0 to cancel independent stack
// return 1 on successfully set, 0 on successfully cancel, < 0 on error
int dyco_coroutine_setStack(int cid, void *stackptr, size_t stacksize);

int dyco_coroutine_getStack(int cid, void **stackptr, size_t *stacksize);

// return 1 on stack size > 7/8 of total, 0 on safe, abort coroutine on stack overflow.
int dyco_coroutine_checkStack();

// return 0 on success
int dyco_coroutine_setUdata(int cid, void *udata);
int dyco_coroutine_getUdata(int cid, void **udata);

// return total yield times of a coroutine 
int dyco_coroutine_getSchedCount(int cid);

// return 0 on success. 
int dyco_coroutine_setUrgent(int cid);
// return 0 on success
int dyco_coroutine_unsetUrgent(int cid);

// return NULL on error
dyco_coropool* dyco_coropool_create(int totalsize, size_t stacksize);
dyco_coropool* dyco_coropool_resize(dyco_coropool* cp, int newsize);

// return 0 on success
int dyco_coropool_destroy(dyco_coropool** cp);

// return number of available coroutine in this pool
int dyco_coropool_available(dyco_coropool* cp);

// obtain a coroutine from the pool. 
// If there is no free coroutine, wait timeout
// return 0 on timeout, -1 on error, > 0 on success
int dyco_coropool_obtain(dyco_coropool* cp, proc_coroutine func, void *arg, int timeout);
int dyco_coropool_obtain_urgent(dyco_coropool* cp, proc_coroutine func, void *arg, int timeout);
```

## Scheduler

Some basic scheduler methods are defined here. In fact, scheduling coroutines is automated in dyco. `create` is **optional**. `run` is enough in most cases. See more in `example/*`.

```c
// return 0 when done, 1 when stopped, < 0 on error
int dyco_schedule_run();

// stack_size: shared stack memory size
// loopwait_timeout: max delay (ms) of starting new coroutine
// return > 0 on success
int dyco_schedule_create(size_t stack_size, uint64_t loopwait_timeout);

void dyco_schedule_free(dyco_schedule *sched);

// return ID of current scheduler
int dyco_schedule_schedID();

int dyco_schedule_setUdata(void *udata);

int dyco_schedule_getUdata(void **udata);

// return total number to coroutines of current scheduler
int dyco_schedule_getCoroCount();
```

## Scheduler Call

Scheduler call provides interfaces for coroutines to influence the behavior of its scheduler, such as globally block some signals, stop or abort the scheduler. See more in `example/stop_abort.c`.

```c
// see sigprocmask
int dyco_schedcall_sigprocmask(int __how, sigset_t *__set, sigset_t *__oset);
// stop current scheduler and make it return as soon as possible
void dyco_schedcall_stop();
// shutdown the scheduler and kill its all coroutines
void dyco_schedcall_abort();
```

## poll/epoll

Although programers use coroutine to achieve asynchronous I/O performance by programming in a synchronous manner, the traditional I/O multiplexing manner is also supported by dyco. If `COROUTINE_HOOK` is enabled, call `epoll_wait` will not block the scheduling loop. `dyco_epoll_xxx` APIs is also provided for convenience. See more in `example/epoll.c`.

```c
// return 0 on success
int dyco_epoll_init();
void dyco_epoll_destroy();
int dyco_epoll_add(int fd, struct epoll_event *ev);
int dyco_epoll_del(int fd, struct epoll_event *ev);

// return number of ready events, < 0 on error
int dyco_epoll_wait(struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents, int timeout);

// see epoll_wait
int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents, int timeout);

// see poll
int poll(struct pollfd *fds, nfds_t nfds, int timeout);
```


## Signal

By calling `dyco_signal` APIs, wait signals will not block the scheduling loop. `waitchild + fork + exec` is helpful in some cases. Other signal is also supported. 

Note that the signals set by calling `signal_init` will be **blocked** until `signal_destroy` is called.

See more in `example/signal.c`.

```c
// return pid of the child on success, < 0 on error
int dyco_signal_waitchild(const pid_t child, int *status, int timeout);
// return 0 on success
int dyco_signal_init(sigset_t *mask);

void dyco_signal_destroy();

// return sizeof struct signalfd_siginfo on success, < 0 on error
int dyco_signal_wait(struct signalfd_siginfo *sinfo, int timeout);
```

## Half Duplex Channel

Half duplex channel is provided for **simple** communications between coroutines. `send` will return only if the channel is empty or the message is received by receiver. See more in `example/channel.c`.

```c
// size: max length of the message
dyco_channel* dyco_channel_create(size_t size);

void dyco_channel_destroy(dyco_channel **chan);

// return the actual sent length, 0 on channel closed, < 0 on error
ssize_t dyco_channel_send(dyco_channel *chan, void *buf, size_t size, int timeout);

// return the actual received length, 0 on channel closed, < 0 on error
ssize_t dyco_channel_recv(dyco_channel *chan, void *buf, size_t maxsize, int timeout);
```

## Publish-subscribe Channel

Pub-Sub channel is provided for **1-to-N** communications. `publish` won't success if there is no subscriber. For each new message, `subscribe` should be called by subscribers, that is, subscribe will not continue automatically. See more in `example/pubsub.c`.

```c
// size: max length of the message
dyco_pubsubchannel* dyco_pubsub_create(size_t size);

void dyco_pubsub_destroy(dyco_pubsubchannel **pschan);

// return the actual published length, 0 on no subscriber, < 0 on error
ssize_t dyco_pubsub_publish(dyco_pubsubchannel *pschan, void *buf, size_t size);

// return the actual received length, < 0 on error
ssize_t dyco_pubsub_subscribe(dyco_pubsubchannel *pschan, void *buf, size_t maxsize, int timeout);
```

## Waitgroup

Waitgroup is provided for **N-to-N** synchronization. Coroutines can join a waitgroup by calling `add`, notify the waitgroup by calling `done`, and wait all or a certain number of other coroutines by calling `wait`. See more in `example/waitgroup.c`.

```c
// suggest_size: estimated max number of coroutines on the waitgroup
dyco_waitgroup* dyco_waitgroup_create(int suggest_size);

void dyco_waitgroup_destroy(dyco_waitgroup **group);

// add coroutine to the waitgroup
int dyco_waitgroup_add(dyco_waitgroup* group, int cid);

// tell the waitgroup this coroutine is done
int dyco_waitgroup_done(dyco_waitgroup* group);

// target: target wait number, set it to -1 to wait until all group member done
// timeout: unit is ms, and set to -1 for persistent waiting
// return > 0 on success, < 0 on error
int dyco_waitgroup_wait(dyco_waitgroup* group, int target, int timeout);
```

## Semaphore

Strictly speaking, each dyco scheduler runs a single thread, where at most one coroutine is running at any time. But these coroutines may ACT LIKE running at the same time. Therefore, semaphore may be helpful in some cases, for example, when we need control the number of active connections. See more in `example/semaphore.c`.

```c
// value: initial value of the semaphore
dyco_semaphore* dyco_semaphore_create(size_t value);
void dyco_semaphore_destroy(dyco_semaphore **sem);

// return 0 on success, < 0 on error or timeout
int dyco_semaphore_wait(dyco_semaphore *sem, int timeout);

// return 0 on success, < 0 on error
int dyco_semaphore_signal(dyco_semaphore *sem);
```

## Socket

dyco socket API can be called the same as socket API, while they will not block the scheduling loop. 
If `COROUTINE_HOOK` is defined, normal socket API will act like dyco socket API. Besides, it will change the behavior of other high level network APIs who call normal socket API in its process, such as database client APIs and DNS APIs. See more in `example/socket_client.c example/socket_server.c example/network.c`.

```c
int dyco_socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
int dyco_close(int fd);
int dyco_accept(int fd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *len);
int dyco_connect(int fd, struct sockaddr *name, socklen_t namelen);
ssize_t dyco_send(int fd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
ssize_t dyco_recv(int fd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
ssize_t dyco_sendto(int fd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags,
		    const struct sockaddr *dest_addr, socklen_t addrlen);
ssize_t dyco_recvfrom(int fd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags,
		      struct sockaddr *src_addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```

## SSL

dyco SSL API is provided to bring great performance gains to SSL communication. But `libssl` and `libcrypto` must be installed before building dyco-coroutine if anyone want to call SSL API. See more in `example/ssl_server.c example/ssl_client`.

**Lack of SSL part is also OK**, the main part of dyco can be built without any dependencies.

```c
// return 1 on success, else on error
int dyco_SSL_accept(SSL *ssl);

// return 1 on success, else on error
int dyco_SSL_connect(SSL *ssl);

// see SSL_read
int dyco_SSL_read(SSL *ssl, void *buf, int num);

// see SSL_write
int dyco_SSL_write(SSL *ssl, const void *buf, int num);
```

## Asymmetric Coroutine & Asymmetric Coroutines Pool

Asymmetric coroutine is also supported, althougth in most case symmetric coroutine is more user-friendly than asymmetric coroutine. There are 2 specific API for asymmetric coroutine: `resume` and `yield`. A asymmetric coroutine can be create in main process or inside any coroutine. **Note that it won't be scheduled by dyco scheduler**. To start the coroutine, you should call `resume` with its `cid`. And inside this coroutines, you can call `yield` to go back to the context where `resume` was called. `resume` will return 0 if the asymmetric coroutine finish. Then you should free this coroutine manually by call `dyco_asymcoro_free`.

Since asymmetric coroutine is not scheduled by dyco scheduler, **all features mentioned before is not supported to asymmetric coroutine**.

`setStack` is **optional**. If a asymmetric coroutine need to be resumed inside a symmetric coroutine, you **must** set a independent stack for this asymmetric coroutine.

See more in `example/asymmetric_example.c`.

**Asymmetric Coroutines Pool** is provided to avoid create and release coroutine/stack memory frequently. The asymmetric coroutines pool can be create at any time and be resized after it created. Asymmetric coroutines who belongs to a asymmetric corotines pool **will not** automatically return to the pool after user function finishes. By calling `obtain`, you can get a free coroutine from the pool. Then by calling `return`, you can return a finished coroutine to the pool.

```c
// return 1 if the coroutine is asymmetric, 0 if symmetric
int dyco_coroutine_isasymmetric(int cid);

// return the coroutine ID on success, < 0 on error
int dyco_asymcoro_create(proc_coroutine func, void *arg);

// return cid on coroutine yield, 0 on coroutine finish, < 0 on error
int dyco_asymcororesume(int cid);

// interupt and go back
void dyco_asymcoroyield();

void dyco_asymcoro_free(int cid);

// return ID of current coroutine
int dyco_asymcoro_coroID();

// stacksize: 0 to cancel independent stack
// return 1 on successfully set, 0 on successfully cancel, < 0 on error
int dyco_asymcoro_setStack(int cid, void *stackptr, size_t stacksize);
int dyco_asymcoro_getStack(int cid, void **stackptr, size_t *stacksize);

// return 0 on success
int dyco_asymcoro_setUdata(int cid, void *udata);
int dyco_asymcoro_getUdata(int cid, void **udata);

// return NULL on error
dyco_coropool* dyco_asymcpool_create(int totalsize, size_t stacksize);
dyco_coropool* dyco_asymcpool_resize(dyco_coropool* cp, int newsize);

// return 0 on success
int dyco_asymcpool_destroy(dyco_coropool** cp);

// return number of available coroutine in this pool
int dyco_asymcpool_available(dyco_coropool* cp);

// obtain a coroutine from the pool. 
// If there is no free coroutine, wait timeout
// return 0 on timeout, -1 on error, > 0 on success
int dyco_asymcpool_obtain(dyco_coropool* cp, proc_coroutine func, void *arg, int timeout);

// return a finished coroutine to the pool
void dyco_asymcpool_return(int cid);
```

# Performance Test

See performance evaluation in [`evaluation.txt`](./evaluation.txt). 

Tools for these test are [NeTest](https://github.com/piaodazhu/netest.git) and programs under `./switchtest/`.

Conclusion: The concurrent throughput of `dyco` is a little lower than epoll IO-multiplexing, and outperforms pthread obviously. And the concurrent throughput and processing latency of `dyco` is very close to `libco`. Besides, The coroutine switch speed of `dyco` is much higher than `libco`, and is the same as `NtyCo`.

# About Coroutine

There are 3 mainstream ways to implement coroutine switch:
- Assembly Instructions. This is faster than other ways, but some code should be written in assembly language for each platform.
- `setjmp()`/`longjmp()`. They are faster than ucontext. But I personally think it is the most inappropriate method of implementing coroutine switch. `setjmp()`/`longjmp()` will loss the stack. To avoid this, you have to set stack pointer in the env_buf structure. This structure is totally different in each platform, so why not use assembly instructions?
- ucontext. This method consists of 4 interfaces which are platform-independent, so the coroutine switch implementation code with ucontext is quite elegant. Unfortunately, **ucontext has been removed from POSIX**, because **the use of function declarators with empty parentheses (not prototype-format parameter type declarators) is an obsolescent feature**. It is still available in Linux, and won't bring problems for dyco. So I choose this method. For supporting more platforms, dyco build ucontext in userspace, and this part is referred to `jamwt/libtask`.
